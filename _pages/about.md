Hey there, I'm Boshen Zhang, currently pursuing my master's degree at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). My area of study is Computer Science with an emphasis on Intelligent Robotics. I completed my undergraduate study at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), where I was guided by Dr. Sara Hooshangi and Dr. Weijun Xie and graduated Magna Cum Laude. 

My current research interests lies in Robot Learning and Human-Robot Interaction. 

When I'm not busy with my studies, I spend my time rock climbing, watching movies, and listening to some music

Feel free send me an email if you have any project related to Robotics & Machine Learning or just want to say hi.
