Hi, I'm Boshen Zhang, I am interested in studying in the intersection of Robotics and AI, especially in scenarios that involves human. 

I received my master's degree at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) and bachelor's degree at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/)

Previously I was a research assistant with with Prof.[Stefanos Nikolaidis](https://www.stefanosnikolaidis.net/) in the [ICAROS](https://icaros.usc.edu/people/) Lab where I focused on synthetic data generation with LLM-powered agents. I have also conducted research with Prof. [Gaurav Sukhatme](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Sukhatme/Gaurav) and Prof.[Feifei Qian](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/roboland) on adaptive communication and collabration. 

My research interests lies in Robot Learning, Human-Robot Interaction and Multi-agent systems. My main research goal is to build embodied agent that makes adaptive, rapid, and robust decisions and work well alongside humans.  

I am also interested in robot expressiveness in which robot exhibits anthropomorphism without adopting a human shape. I really loved the idea of making robot of a helpful friend.

For leisure, I spend my time rock climbing, watching movies, and listening to music.

Feel free to send me an email!
