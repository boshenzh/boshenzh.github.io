Hey there, I'm Boshen Zhang, currently pursuing my master's degree at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). My area of study is Computer Science with an emphasis on Intelligent Robotics. I am fortunate to work with Prof.[Stefanos Nikolaidis](https://www.stefanosnikolaidis.net/). I completed my undergraduate study at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), where I was guided by Dr. [Sara Hooshangi](https://nvc.cs.vt.edu/faculty/Sara-Hooshangi.html) and Dr. [Weijun Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/weijunxieor/home) and graduated Magna Cum Laude.

My current research interests lies in Multi-agent systems, Robot Learning, and Human-Robot Interaction. My main research goal is to build embodied agent that makes adaptive, rapid, and robust decisions and work well alongside humans. I hope we can build and play with systems like [MOSS](https://the-wandering-earth.fandom.com/wiki/550W_(MOSS))(Wandering Earth) and [TARS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVEfFHzUby0)(Interstellar) someday!

When I'm not busy with my studies, I spend my time rock climbing, watching movies/reality show, and listening to music.

I love collabration. Feel free to send me an email for any potential collabration or just simply want to chat about life and career.
