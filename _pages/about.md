Hey there, I'm Boshen Zhang, currently pursuing my master's degree at the University of Southern California, my focus lies primarily in the convergence of Robotics and Machine Learning, where I'm constantly exploring ways to infuse artificial intelligence into the latest robotic innovations, all geared toward making people's daily lives a tad more seamless. My academic journey commenced at Virginia Tech, where I pursued my bachelor in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics. 

When I'm not busy with my studies, I love the excitement of rock climbing. If I'm not doing that, I'm probably getting lost in a good movie or jamming to some great tunes.

Feel free to drop me a line if you've got a cool software, Robotics, or Machine Learning project brewing. I'm always up for diving into new and exciting challenges alongside like-minded enthusiasts.

Also, if you're in the mood for some indoor bouldering action, count me in!
