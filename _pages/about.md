Hey there, I'm Boshen Zhang, currently immersed in the world of Intelligent Robotics as a spirited master's student at the University of Southern California. My passion lies in the fascinating realms of Robotics and Machine Learning, where I'm constantly exploring ways to infuse artificial intelligence into the latest robotic innovations, all geared toward making people's daily lives a tad more seamless. Originally from the vibrant land of China, I kick-started my academic journey at Virginia Tech, delving into the realms of Computer Science & Applied Mathematics.

In the midst of academia, I find solace in the sheer thrill of conquering rocky terrains through exhilarating rock climbing adventures. When I'm not scaling new heights, you'll often catch me absorbed in the magic of captivating movies or swaying to the rhythm of diverse musical beats.
