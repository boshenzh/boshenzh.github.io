An Research project aims to develop effective model for drunk driver interdiction game. Given a limited policing resource and the information of historic
DUI driving events, this project is to build a model to study how to set up optimal policing resources to
prevent DUI events. There are two groups of drivers we are considering risk-taking ones and risk-averse
one. So it would be important to learn these driversâ€™ patterns and set up an optimal policing plan. I developed a website for users to play with.
